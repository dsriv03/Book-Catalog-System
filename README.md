# Book-Catalog-System
This is the (now archived) book cataloging system made in fulfillment of my web development course. It features a basic login system and personal read lists for each user.
Due to time constraints, the project lacks extensive error checking and a dynamic book lookup system. I had initially planned to include automatic pulling of information from a public book database such as scribd but I didn't have enough time to learn API handling. Not a project I'm proud of, but a good learning opportunity for SQL connections and PHP.
